**Effective Date:** February 21, 2026 — **Last Updated:** February 21, 2026

## Introduction

SCOPEOut ("the Extension," "we," "our," or "us") is a browser extension for Google Chrome. This Privacy Policy describes how SCOPEOut collects, uses, processes, and transmits user data in connection with its operation. By installing and using SCOPEOut, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

---

## Data We Collect

SCOPEOut may collect and process the following categories of data solely to provide its core functionality:

| Data Type | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Active webpage content** | Scraped and analyzed to perform the extension's primary function |
| **User-provided input** | Queries or prompts entered by the user within the extension interface |
| **Temporary session data** | Used in-memory during a browsing session; not persisted |

We do **not** collect:
- Personally identifiable information (PII) beyond what is incidentally present in user-selected page content
- Browsing history or cross-site tracking data
- Authentication credentials, passwords, or payment information
- Device identifiers or persistent user profiles

---

## How We Use Your Data

Data collected by SCOPEOut is used **exclusively** to provide the extension's stated functionality. Specifically:

- **Webpage content** selected or captured by the extension is transmitted to **Google's Gemini API** for natural language processing and analysis.
- **User-provided prompts** are transmitted alongside that content to the Gemini API to generate contextually relevant responses.
- No data is retained by SCOPEOut beyond the active session. We do not operate servers that store your data.

---

## Data Sharing and Third Parties

SCOPEOut transmits user data to the following third party **solely as necessary** to perform its core function:

### Google Gemini API
- **Data Shared:** Active page content and user-entered prompts
- **Purpose:** AI-powered analysis and response generation
- **Privacy Policy:** [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- **Terms of Service:** [Google Generative AI Terms](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai)

We do **not** share, sell, transfer, or disclose user data to:
- Advertising platforms or ad networks
- Data brokers or information resellers
- Credit or financial services providers
- Any other third party not described in this policy

---

## Data Transmission Security

All data transmitted between SCOPEOut and the Google Gemini API is sent exclusively over **encrypted HTTPS connections** using modern TLS cryptography. We do not transmit user data over unencrypted channels.

---

## Data Retention

SCOPEOut does **not** persistently store, log, or retain user data. All data processed during use of the extension exists only for the duration of the active request and is discarded thereafter. No user data is written to local storage, remote databases, or any server operated by the extension's developer.

---

## Permissions

SCOPEOut requests only the minimum browser permissions necessary to deliver its functionality. Each permission serves an explicit, user-facing purpose disclosed on the Chrome Web Store listing and within the extension's interface. We do not request permissions to "future-proof" the extension for unimplemented features.

---

## Limited Use Disclosure

> **The use of information received from Google APIs adheres to the Chrome Web Store User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.**

SCOPEOut's access to and use of user data is strictly limited to:
- Providing and improving the single stated purpose of the extension
- Compliance with applicable laws
- Protection against malware, spam, phishing, or other fraud or abuse

No human affiliated with this extension will read, access, or review your individual user data unless you have provided explicit consent, it is necessary for a security investigation, or it is required by applicable law.

---

## Children's Privacy

SCOPEOut is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided data through this extension, please contact us so we may take appropriate action.

---

## Your Rights and Choices

Because SCOPEOut does not retain user data, there is no stored data to access, correct, or delete. You may uninstall the extension at any time via your browser's extension management page to cease all data processing by the extension.

---

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of the extension following any changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
